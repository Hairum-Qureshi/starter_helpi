	**Recommended Careers:**
	
	**1. Software Developer (Specific Focus: Health & Wellness Applications)**
	Given your interest in software development and health and wellness promotion, a career in creating applications focused on health and wellness could be highly rewarding. This career would utilize your coding skills, particularly your experience with the MERN stack, and enable you to contribute to areas you care about, such as wellness and preventive healthcare technologies.

This pathway also offers great potential for recognition within tech and health communities, aligning with your aspiration for appreciation of your contributions.

Given your analytical skills and interest in making meaningful contributions to societal issues, this career could be fulfilling. The position usually comes with flexible working options and has significant growth potential as data-driven decision-making becomes more integral to public health.
	
	**3. Health Tech Product Manager**
	Transitioning into a product management role within a health tech company could be an excellent fit. It allows you to oversee the development and deployment of technology products that enhance health outcomes. This position would leverage your technical background and interest in health and wellness, offering opportunities for leadership and recognition.
